## Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb data to uncover insights and trends regarding hosts, guests, pricing, and listings. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting Airbnb rental prices and to explore patterns in property types, locations, customer reviews, and more.

The analysis helps stakeholders (hosts, guests, and policymakers) make informed decisions about pricing strategies, customer preferences, and market demand.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes various features about Airbnb listings such as:
- **Listing ID**
- **Host Information**
- **Property Type**
- **Neighborhood**
- **Price**
- **Review Scores**
- **Availability**
- **Number of Reviews**

## Key Findings

Some key insights from the analysis include:
1. **Price Distribution**: A large variance in listing prices depending on location and property type.
2. **Review Patterns**: Listings with higher review counts tend to have more stable pricing, indicating a trust factor.
3. **Neighborhood Trends**: Certain neighborhoods exhibit consistently higher demand and prices.
4. **Booking Frequency**: Seasonality and availability significantly affect pricing and demand.

These insights can help both hosts optimize their pricing strategies and guests make better booking decisions.
